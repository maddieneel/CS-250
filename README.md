# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
From doing an initial meeting with the customer, the product owner gets a general idea of what they wish to accomplish. Afterwards, the product owner creates the user stories. User stories help with implementing them into a program by giving the requirements of the project. Not only that, but user stories give the priority levels and sizes of what needs to be focused on the most. This will give the tester the ability to create test cases, including pass and fail requirements (more specifications than user stories). After development, the user story will be tested and reviewed. This process will be repeated until all of the user stories are finished. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
First and foremost, before developing a program, it is important to use an approach that best fits your setting/project. If agile methodology is chosen, it is important that all members understand and enact the agile concepts. If they do not, the scrum master will provide guidance and coaching on agile principles. One of the agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work is the ability of change. Although that can be taken many ways, the ability to change allows for improvement, customer satisfaction, and more. If I am in an agile setting, I believe daily scrums would also be very beneficial to me. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development accepts criticism without feeling discouraged. If someone is struggling, encourage improvement and help them understand how to move forward. Good communication is important, especially in an agile setting. Overall, having mutual respect between all team members will allow for a healthy work environment.
